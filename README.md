# SQL

# Alex the Analyst Bootcamp

Contains the SQL tutorials and portfolio projects completed as part of Alex the Analyst's Bootcamp on YouTube.

As part of this bootcamp, I learned Azure Data Studio on Mac using MySQL syntax, as well as SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) on Windows using TSQL syntax. For this portfolio project, I used SSMS and TSQL syntax.
