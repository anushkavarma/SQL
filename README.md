# COVID Deaths and Vaccinations Project

## About the Data
The data for this project was COVID data from OurWorldInData, containing data from 2020-2024. I divided this data into two tables, Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations for this project.

## Purpose
This project seeks to determine the likelihood of dying if one contracted COVID. The aim is also to find the infection rate for the American population. I then looked globally to find the total cases, deaths, and death percentage, and finally, the vaccinations by country as a rolling count.

## Methodology
For this portfolio project, I used SSMS and TSQL syntax.
